Important points on Database design
---
Good SQL starts with a design
Database should reflect real life not for your convinence
If the design is wrong/bad no query is going to save you
The relationship which has a attribute deserves a table
Never asume that everything is perfect in your system according to real life
If your database desing does not give/solve your real life answers so the design is not perfect


Structuring Complex SQL
---
Complex logic needs clear steps
2. CTE breaks queries into readable blocks (Common Table Expression)  to solve filtration with aggregation
3. same result but cleaner thinking
4. Easier to debug and maintain
CTE
with total_payment as (

),
avg_enrolls as(

)
give new table temparary
only avilable for 1 query table deleted after ;


Why Some Queries Are slow
---
performance depends on data touched
filtering early reduces works
joins can multiply rows
Less work = faster queries


Seeing How MySQL execute queries
---
metadata of query type column giving all which is very wrong
